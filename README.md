POSA-14
=======

This repository contains assignments and examples for the 2014 offering of the POSA MOOC (see www.coursera.org/course/posa for more information)


The projects I completed for Dr. Douglas Schmidt's Pattern-Oriented Software Architectures: Programming Mobile Services for Android Handheld Systems, given on Coursera, starting in May 2014 and ending in July 2014. This class was the second in the Mobile Cloud Computing on Android Specialization.

These projects focused on creating applications that worked on an Galaxy Nexus using API 19. In completing the course with a verified certificate with distinction, I was able to move on in the next course in the series. My grade for the class was 71.5, and was totaled from completion of the projects and quizzes.

I will be updating this repo with the work I completed for this class, as some of my files were missing from the original upload.

For more information on the class and to view my certificate, see https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/ZZ5EB8GeNEvnXQG3
